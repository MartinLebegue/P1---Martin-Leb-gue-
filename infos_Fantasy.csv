A darkly gripping, page-turning thriller that will enthrall fans of Rachel Abbott, Alex Marwood’s The Wicked Girls and Mark Edwards. Praise for Caroline Mitchell:‘Fan-bloody-tastic! I enjoyed this book so much that I forced myself to read slowly as I just could not bear for it to end… I thought the story was brilliant. The characters were creative and kept me hooked. ‘The twists and turns kept me gasping for more… Could not recommend this book any more highly!’ Crime Book Junkie ‘This is a well written supernatural detective story, with a surprising twist that I guarantee will keep you glued to the last page… at times I couldn’t turn the pages quickly enough, it’s atmospheric, gritty and at times just plain scary, and what a twist at the end.’ The Book Review Café ‘With a brilliant cast of crime characters, and a plot that was enough to make me feel dizzy, this was a compelling book that I just couldn't get enough of. Every word, every page, every murder, every guess... I couldn't wait for the final piece of the jigsaw to fit into place… the word 'thrilling' just doesn't do this justice.’ Becca’s Books ...more",3,9e9932ae1a7d0943,Books,£36.25,£36.25,£0.00,In stock (1 available),0
